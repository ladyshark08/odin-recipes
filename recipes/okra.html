<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This recipe uses onions. Yes, you read well. Onions in okra soup have 
    always been an issue that is really debated. It is believed that onions make the soup less viscous. This can be true if a lot of onion is added; however, if a little is added, as I did in this recipe, your okro soup will be nice, thick, and viscous. 
    If you are not comfortable using it, you can skip it.
</p>

<p>
    Okra soup is often classically made with beef (beef parts) and fish. However, 
    shrimps, Lamb Meat, goat meat, or any other meat or fish of choice can be used.
